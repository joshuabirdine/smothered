# smothered

Smothered is a Soul food vegan concept. I decided for my first project of the year I would complete this only using my phone.

The web app will use HTML/CSS and JS for the front end. I might add either React or Angular.
For the backend I will use Python and Django and hosting it on Heroku.

I honestly have no idea where this application will take me to but I will try to have as much fun as I can with it.
